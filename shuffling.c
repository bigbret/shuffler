//There will need to a song struct
//Should Define in a header file first
typedef struct{
    char title[50]; //This will hold the title of the song
    char artist[50]; //This will hold the arist name
    char genre[50]; //This will hold the genre of the song 
    int length; //this will hold the duration of the song (Unknown Use yet, but good information)
    int pop; //this will be a scale of popularity (Possibly out of 100?) This should be of the artist + song

}Song;


//This will be a function to build a song
Song* 


//Need to be able to build a linked list with the song structs
//as its data 

//Need to build a comaprator function for the linked list to take in 
//data 

//possibly need to find a way to take in song statistics 
//order and rank them in a way
